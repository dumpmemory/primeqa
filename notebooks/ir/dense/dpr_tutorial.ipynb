It is believed that the first `` European descent '' expedition to enter southern Idaho was by a group led in 1811 and 1812 by Wilson Price Hunt , which navigated the Snake River while attempting to blaze an all - water trail westward from St. Louis , Missouri , to Astoria , Oregon . At that time , approximately 8,000 Native Americans lived in the region . Fur trading led to the first significant incursion of Europeans in the region . Andrew Henry of the Missouri Fur Company first entered the Snake River plateau in 1810 . He built Fort Henry on Henry 's Fork on the upper Snake River , near modern St. Anthony , Idaho . However , this first American fur post west of the Rocky Mountains was abandoned the following spring .

Out of Fort George in Astoria , Mackenzie led fur brigades up the Snake River in 1816 - 1817 and up the lower Snake in 1817 - 1818 . Fort Nez Perce , established in July , 1818 , became the staging point for Mackenzies ' Snake brigades . The expedition of 1818 - 1819 explored the Blue Mountains , and traveled down the Snake River to the Bear River and approached the headwaters of the Snake . Mackenzie sought to establish a navigable route up the Snake River from Fort Nez Perce to the Boise area in 1819 . While he did succeed in traveling by boat from the Columbia River through the Grand Canyon of the Snake past Hells Canyon , he concluded that water transport was generally impractical . Mackenzie held the first rendezvous in the region on the Boise River in 1819 . Despite their best efforts\",\n",
      "            \", early American fur companies in this region had difficulty maintaining the long - distance supply lines from the Missouri River system into the Intermountain West . However , Americans William H. Ashley and Jedediah Smith expanded the Saint Louis fur trade into Idaho in 1824 . The 1832 trapper 's rendezvous at Pierre 's Hole , held at the foot of the Three Tetons in modern Teton County , was followed by an intense battle between the Gros Ventre and a large party of American trappers aided by their Nez Perce and Flathead allies . The prospect of missionary work among the Native Americans also attracted early settlers to the region . In 1809 , Kullyspell House , the first white - owned establishment and first trading post in Idaho , was constructed . In 1836 , the Reverend Henry H. Spalding established a Protestant mission near Lapwai , where he printed the Northwest 's first book , established Idaho 's first school , developed its first irrigation system , and grew the state 's first potatoes . Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding were the first non-native women to enter present - day Idaho . Cataldo Mission , the oldest standing building in Idaho , was constructed at Cataldo by the Coeur d'Alene and Catholic missionaries . In 1842 , Father Pierre - Jean De Smet , with Fr.

The Lewis and Clark expedition entered present - day Idaho on August 12 , 1805 , at Lemhi Pass . It is believed that the first `` European descent '' expedition to enter southern Idaho was by a group led in 1811 and 1812 by Wilson Price Hunt , which navigated the Snake River while attempting to blaze an all - water trail westward from St. Louis , Missouri , to Astoria , Oregon . At that time , approximately 8,000 Native Americans lived in the region . Fur trading led to the first significant incursion of Europeans in the region . Andrew Henry of the Missouri Fur Company first entered the Snake River plateau in 1810 . He built Fort Henry on Henry 's Fork on the upper Snake River , near modern St. Anthony , Idaho . However , this first American fur post west of the Rocky Mountains was abandoned the following spring . The British - owned Hudson 's Bay Company next entered Idaho and controlled the trade in the Snake River area by the 1820s . The North West Company 's interior department of the Columbia was created in June 1816 , and Donald Mackenzie was assigned as its head .

The first organized town in Idaho was Franklin , settled in April 1860 by Mormon pioneers who believed they were in Utah Territory ; although a later survey determined they had in fact crossed the border .

Although free , many blacks suffered discrimination in the early - to - mid-late 20th century . The black population of the state continues to grow as many come to the state because of educational opportunities , to serve in the military , and for other employment opportunities . There is a Black History Museum in Boise , Idaho , with an exhibit known as the `` Invisible Idahoan '' , which chronicles the first African - Americans in the state .
